A project from The Odin Project that works on the topic of recursion. In the first assignment, it of interest to invoke a fibonacci method by iteration where the method #fibs takes a number and returns the many numbers of the fibonacci sequence. A second fibonacci method is to solve the same problems recursively using the method #fibs_rec. On the second assignment, the method #merge_sort takes in an array and returns a sorted array.
